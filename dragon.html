                            <p>The Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 7 passengers to and from Earth orbit,
                                and
                                beyond. The pressurized section of the capsule is designed to carry both people and
                                environmentally sensitive cargo. Towards the base of the capsule and contained within
                                the
                                nose

                                Dragon’s trunk not only carries unpressurized cargo but also supports the spacecraft
                                during
                                ascent. The trunk remains attached to Dragon until shortly before reentry into Earth’s
                                atmosphere.</p>
